# cssBayan
I have created an accordion with HTML and CSS only.
## To see result [cssBayan](https://regemler.github.io/cssBayan/cssBayan/index.html)
## Functional requirements:
1. Center the accordion component on the screen, with equal indents on the left and right;
2. Implement responsive design. Accordion is displayed correctly at `mobile 320x568, tablet 820x1180, desktop 1920Ã—1080`.
3. Font size should be changed at each device (mobile, tablet, desktop).
4. Design is at your discretion, but the layout of an accordion should include a meme image, text, and an icon. The placement of these elements should match the provided above example image.
5. There should be icon for state of the expanded\collapsed item (you can choose your own icons e.g. from FontAwesome).
6. Smooth transitions are applied for changing of memes and for changing of icon.
7. Make the entire row (text, icon, and meme image) clickable.
10. Change the cursor when it is hovering over the accordion.
11. Initially, the first meme should be chosen/selected.
12. Chosen/selected meme should be always expanded. Selecting another meme makes this unselected (and collapsed).
13. Click on meme makes it selected.
